Project Title: Coding Quiz

Overview

Coding Quiz was a challenge to build a java script quiz application that looked liked the attached Gif file ![code quiz](./Assets/04-web-apis-homework-demo.gif]
and functioned like the attached GIF and met this criteria:

*GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
*THEN I am presented with another question
*WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
*THEN time is subtracted from the clock
*WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
*THEN the game is over
*WHEN the game is over
*THEN I can save my initials and score


Project Notes:
Coding Quiz wasa a tough challenge. In hind site I made several mistakes. One major one was I copied the create pizza reference code from slack 
and wrote over top of it. It made every line of code very glitchy. I spent a lot of time trying to fix glitches and I don't yet have 
command of the java script language. I put so much time into building this application but unfortunatley I fell short of meeting the criteria, but
I learned a lot. I hope you take all the work into consideration when grading. I learned a lot and it was good experience.
